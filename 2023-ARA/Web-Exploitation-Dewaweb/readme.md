Our approach was checking the sources of the website. First, we checked the HTML source of the given website. It gives us the first part of the flag here.

```
part-1 : ARA2023{s4nt4I_
```

Next, we try to check the CSS sources of the website. It gives us the third part of the flag instead of the second part. It located in `/css/style.css`.
